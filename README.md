Clojure Targeting R 

Cloju'R'e is the Clojure functional language (dialect of Lisp) targeting the R statistical analysis environment. The goal is to transition R to the JVM using Renjin and endowing it with one of the most promising functional languages. We believe that this approach will bring the cultivated R environment into the mainstream. With a vast number of iron clad statistical libraries coupled with an elegant language and endowed with a portable environment, Cloju'R'e may become a leading Statistical development tool.


This project is dedicated to combining the power of the open source R and Clojure communities.The long term vision is to integrate the R environment and Clojure to an seamless dynamic REPL type IDE. 


A domain specific language for R is created using existing R documentation. This provides rapid development of the R functions. The power of Clojure is not realized in R transformationed functions and thus the extension of R DSL will be required to allow idiomatic Clojure programming. Further it will be possible to use the R extension library to create Clojure R Jars.
